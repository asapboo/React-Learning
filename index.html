<!--
  JSX lets you write Markdown in JS in a way that it understands. It has 3 rules
  1. Things need to be CamelCased
  2. All tags must be manually closed </>
  3. If you want to have multiple elements in something, you must inclose in a <div> or empty tags <>
-->

<!-- React is a Javscript Library that lets you easily update the DOM to build UI's without writing redundant
code that makes you append classes. React is declaritive instead of impertive, it figures out how to adjust the Dom for you instead of you telling it what to do
It's also just a Javascript library so it doesn't really care what the rest of your stack is which is great
-->

<!-- Theres 3 Basic Ideas in React: -->

<!--
  1. Component - Usable bits of code to adjust the DOM. 

  In React, Components are just functions with Return values in JSX.
  Components must be capitalized to differentiate between normal js
  Pass React Components like all HTML elements with angle brackets <>
  
  ReactDOM.render(Component, ElementID)
  
  <script>
  function header() {
    return (<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship. ðŸš€</h1>)
  }
  ReactDOM.render(<Header />, app)
  </script>


  -- Can also have nested components to build a nice component tree. --

  This function is nesting the header comonent inside homepage. Then we can pass the Homepage component.
  function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Nesting the Header component */}
      <Header />
    </div>
    );
  }
  
  ReactDOM.render(<HomePage />, app);
-->

<!-- 
  2. Props - Passing Data between Components

  Like how in HTML you can change the src of an img to change it, etc props are arguments that can be passed
  to a react component, and change the state of something.

  You can pass a prop like a class or ID in html,, all child components inherit the prop values
  Can use props to change what's displayed. 
  Ex. Pass prop {coloredHeart} in the child component that returns this string to change the copy of "I love coding {coloredHeart}".

  ** You can use {} to tap in & out of JS inside of React

  function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title ? title : 'Default title'}</h1>;

  function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="React ðŸ’™" />
      <Header title="A new title" />
    </div>
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(<Page />, app);
-->

<!--
  3. States

  States help us use event handlers to change them!
  onClick={} is a REACT event that lets us change the state, React has a bunch of camelCased events that let us change the state of things
  onChange for input fields
  onSubmit for forms

  React has set of hooks you can use to add additional logic to your states ->>> useState()
  useState() returns an array where the first value is the state value, and the second items is the function to update the value [stateValue, Function]

  Counts the number of times the Likes Button has been Clicked, initalized at 0;
  function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setLikes(likes + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Likes ({likes})</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Note** Props only pass data but changes to states can be permananet!
